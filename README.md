### **Wrangler Lambda**

A Lambda function to handle incoming requests containing Question Code and value having the following JSON format:

    {
      "responses": [
        {
          "questionCode": "601",
          "response": "146"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "602",
          "response": "150"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "700",
          "response": "148"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "603",
          "response": "602"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "701",
          "response": "603"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "605",
          "response": "604"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "606",
          "response": "605"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "607",
          "response": "606"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "608",
          "response": "607"
        },
        {
          "questionCode": "609",
          "response": "608"
        }
      ]
    }

    Hard coded  Validation Config which has list of QuestionCode and Derived Question Code combinations for example

                Question Code 601 Derived Question Code 700
                Question Code 602 Derived Question Code 701


Looping through the Validation Config and prepare Json for calling Validation Lambda i.e VET

The Prepared Json would be similar to

    {
        "primaryValue":"146",
        "comparisonValue":"148",
        "metaData":null
    }

 Call the Validation Lambda for a each item in Validation Config and store each ValidationResult in a list

 The Output from Value comparison VET would be similar to

 {
   "valueFormula": "146 != 148",
   "triggered": true
 }

 Amend the Question Code to each ValidationResult similar to

 [{"questionCode":"601","valueFormula":"146 != 148","triggered":"true"},{"questionCode":"602","valueFormula":"150 != 603","triggered":"true"}]

 Add Survey, period, reference and instance parameters to the result list and build the JSON in the following format

 {
   "type": "POST",
   "input": {
     "period": "201211",
     "reference": "4990012",
     "survey": "066",
     "instance": "instanceid",
     "validationName": "QvDQ",
     "validationResults": [
       {
         "questionCode": "601",
         "valueFormula": "146 != 148",
         "triggered": "true"
       },
       {
         "questionCode": "602",
         "valueFormula": "150 != 603",
         "triggered": "true"
       }
     ]
   }
 }

 Make a call to Response Persistence Lambda

 Lambda Name: response-persistence-lambda

 Verify the following output

 {"response":"Persisted Successfully"}





The following configuration is required:


WRANGLER_NAME - the name of the wrangler lambda i.e VET being called within the eu-west-2 region - takeon-val-comparison-dev-valueComparison

WRANGLER_NAME_RESPONSE_PERSISTENCE - the name of the Response persistence Lambda - response-persistence-lambda

TOPIC_ARN - BPM stuff - - the arn of the topic that messages will be published to -  arn:aws:sns:eu-west-2:014669633018:Take-On-Validation-SNS
